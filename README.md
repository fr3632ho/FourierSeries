# Fourier Transforms and Series
This program is intended as a side project, for fun, to visualize the fourier series/transform. Still under implementation!
### Visualization
Matplotlib has been used for the visualization part of the program. This might be changed later to increase performance.

### Fourier Series
So far the program is able to visualize the fourier series by using the property of orthogonality between the sine and cosine wave. Information about the matter can be found [here](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FourierSeries.html). Adding upp n periodic waves (sines), where n = 1,2,...,n we can visualize the concatenation of such waves and show the different behavior.

The formula used for the series can be found on the [wiki](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fourier_series).

### Fourier Transform
The implementation used is the [discrete fourier transform](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Discrete_Fourier_transform) which, according to the wiki, converts a finite sequence of equally-spaced samples of a signal and converts it into a discrete-time fourier transform which is a complex-valued function of frequency!

The formula used can be found on the wiki!
